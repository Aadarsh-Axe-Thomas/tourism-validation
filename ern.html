		<p>Ernakulam (Malayalam: [erɐɳɐːkuɭɐm] ) is the central portion of the city of Kochi in Kerala, India and has lent its name to the Ernakulam district. Many major establishments, including the Kerala High Court, the office of the Kochi Municipal Corporation and the Cochin Shipyard are situated here.

Initially, Ernakulam was the headquarters of the Ernakulam District but was later shifted to Kakkanad, an eastern region in Kochi. Ernakulam was once the capital of the Kingdom of Cochin.
